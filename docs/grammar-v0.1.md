# Jadpo core grammar v0.1

**Status:** provisional implementation contract  
**Scope:** the first semantic compiler and Jadpo seed application  
**Not scope:** the complete language described by the broader syntax draft

This grammar freezes the smallest coherent source subset needed to build the
compiler front end. It intentionally excludes unresolved features rather than
letting parser code decide their semantics.

DATA-007, TX-001, CONSISTENCY-001, and WORKFLOW-001 now accept the [entity,
query, transaction, and cross-store consistency model](entity-query-model.md).
First-class `entity` dossiers are the accepted source model for identity-bearing
concepts; `type ... = Object` describes identity-free values. Legacy `type` plus
`persist` productions remain compatibility syntax, not the recommended model
for new applications. The bounded dossier/query/consistency surface below is
fixture-backed and executable; physical derived-store adapters and durable
workflow execution remain outside this grammar's runtime claim.

TIME-001 and TEST-001 accept the digest-pinned
[time and testing contract](time-testing-plan.md). The implemented prelude uses
`Instant`, `CalendarDate`, resolved zone-aware `Time`, fixed `Duration`, generated
`Zone`, bounded `Locale`, and presentation-classified text. Section 14 lists
these current names; the old `Date`/`DateTime` spellings are not alternatives for
new source. Authored tests and fixtures are described with the compilation unit below.

The semantic rules remain authoritative in the [semantic model](semantic-model.md),
[type system](type-system.md), and [failure model](failure-model.md). This
document controls spelling for the core compiler slice.

## 1. Source files and namespace

- Source files use the `.jadpo` extension.
- A project consists of all `.jadpo` files discovered beneath its source root.
- The core compiler has one application-wide namespace.
- Declaration order and file order do not affect name resolution.
- Duplicate names in the same namespace are errors.
- The bounded module extension supports one logical module per file, selective
  imports, and private-by-default declarations. Packages remain deferred.

## 2. Lexical grammar

The notation below is EBNF-like:

- `{ X }` means zero or more;
- `[ X ]` means optional;
- `( A | B )` means a choice;
- quoted text is a literal token.

```ebnf
letter              = "A".."Z" | "a".."z" ;
digit               = "0".."9" ;
identifier          = ( letter | "_" ), { letter | digit | "_" } ;
integer_literal     = [ "-" ], digit, { digit } ;
decimal_literal     = [ "-" ], digit, { digit }, ".", digit, { digit } ;
string_literal      = '"', { string_character | escape }, '"' ;
boolean_literal     = "true" | "false" ;
none_literal        = "none" ;

line_comment        = "//", { character_except_newline } ;
whitespace          = space | tab | newline | line_comment ;
```

Strings initially support `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\r`, and `\t`. Invalid UTF-8,
invalid escapes, and unterminated strings are lexical diagnostics.

Whitespace, newlines, and comments are non-semantic. The parser retains source
spans and comment trivia for diagnostics and future documentation tooling.

## 3. Naming diagnostics

Naming shape is checked semantically rather than encoded into token kinds. The
accepted [naming and qualification contract](naming-and-qualification.md) is
authoritative:

- nominal/type-like declarations use `UpperCamelCase`;
- fields, parameters, bindings, functions, actions, queries, jobs, capability
  instances, and variants use `lower_snake_case`;
- module segments and standard-library namespaces use `lower_snake_case`; and
- language keywords are lowercase.

The lexer emits one `identifier` token so a misspelt case can receive a targeted
naming diagnostic rather than a confusing parse error.

`input`, `output`, and `value` are contextual in name positions. The former
declaration spellings remain readable only for migration fixtures; canonical
source declares every shape with `type`. These words may still be used as
parameter, binding, field, or expression names. The seed's
`input: RegisterCustomer` is the canonical boundary-role example. This is a
parser rule, not implicit string rewriting.

## 4. Compilation unit

```ebnf
source_file         = [ module_declaration ], { import_declaration },
                      { [ "public" ], declaration } ;

declaration         = type_declaration
                    | application_declaration
                    | principal_declaration
                    | config_declaration
                    | entity_declaration
                    | persistence_declaration
                    | failure_declaration
                    | function_declaration
                    | action_declaration
                    | query_declaration
                    | route_declaration
                    | job_declaration
                    | fixture_declaration
                    | test_declaration ;
```

The `application` declaration owns project-wide capabilities; it is not a
wrapper around the other declarations. The bounded module/import extension is
specified in section 15.

### 4.1 Application authentication and principal

```ebnf
application_declaration
                    = "application", identifier, "{",
                      application_authentication,
                      "}" ;
application_authentication
                    = "authentication", "{",
                      "principal", ":", type_expression,
                      revocation_declaration,
                      "}" ;
revocation_declaration
                    = "revocation", "{",
                      "mode", ":", revocation_mode,
                      [ "maximum_delay", ":", duration_literal ],
                      "}" ;
revocation_mode     = "immediate" | "bounded" ;
duration_literal    = ( integer_literal | decimal_literal ),
                      ( "ms" | "s" | "m" | "h" | "d" ) ;

principal_declaration
                    = "principal", identifier, "{",
                      { principal_variant },
                      "}" ;
principal_variant   = ( "user" | "service" ), object_body ;
```

A project has at most one application and one principal declaration. The
principal is closed over exactly one `user` and one `service` variant. Bounded
revocation requires a positive `maximum_delay`; immediate revocation forbids
one. Strategy selection and typed principal resolution are implemented. Fully
configured first-party user strategies can generate protected routes; unsupported
strategies and principal mappings remain fail-closed.

**Selected successor, not implemented here (2026-10-04):** the owner selected
`principal { ... }` without an authored name, supplying the compiler-defined
`Principal` type and existing `current_principal` value. Remove the redundant
principal-selector configuration in the same reviewed migration. The EBNF above
still describes the current named form. RM-222/RM-223 must specify and verify the
successor while preserving authenticated provenance, closed variants and frozen
baseline evidence; see the [naming/principal decision](decision-register.md#naming-and-principal-direction--2026-10-04).

```ebnf
authentication_strategy = "authentication", identifier, "{",
                          { authentication_item }, "}" ;
authentication_item = transport | validators | claims | resolution ;
transport           = "transport", "{",
                      ( "cookie", ":", string_literal
                      | "bearer", ":", "authorization_header" ), "}" ;
validators          = "validators", "{", { validator }, "}" ;
validator           = identifier, "{", "mode", ":", identifier,
                      "principal", ":", ( "user" | "service" ),
                      { validator_setting | credential_binding }, "}" ;
validator_setting   = identifier, ":", expression ;
credential_binding  = "credentials", "{",
                      "identity", ":", qualified_name,
                      "principal", ":", qualified_name,
                      "verifier", ":", qualified_name,
                      "active", ":", expression,
                      "expires", ":", qualified_name,
                      "revoked", ":", qualified_name, "}" ;
claims              = "claims", "{", { authentication_mapping }, "}" ;
authentication_mapping = identifier, "->", qualified_name ;
resolution          = "resolution", ( "user" | "service" ), "{",
                      "authority", ":", qualified_name,
                      "active", ":", expression,
                      "mappings", "{", { authentication_mapping }, "}",
                      "inactive", ":", identifier, "}" ;
```

Each strategy has one transport and a nonempty validator set. First-party
validator settings are `secret`, optional `previous_secret`, `audience`, and
cookie `origin`. Keys must reference secret textual configuration; audience and
origin must be non-secret text literals or configuration references. Duplicate
or unsupported settings are errors. Signed credential lifetime uses the
application's bounded revocation limit; opaque session lifetime is supplied at
the trusted host issuance boundary. See the
[first-party example](../examples/first-party-authentication/README.md) for the
supported runtime subset and remaining gates.

A service `api_key` validator may declare one `credentials` binding. Its six
roles are required exactly once and may appear in any order. Duplicate, unknown
or missing roles are errors. The [service runtime boundary](auth-runtime-extensions.md#service-credentials)
owns the supported field types, authority/reference checks and constructible
active-predicate subset; other validator modes cannot declare the binding.

### 4.2 Bounded entity dossier and named query extension

```ebnf
entity_declaration  = "entity", identifier, "{",
                      { entity_field | entity_dossier_item | entity_operation },
                      "}" ;
entity_field        = identifier, ":", type_expression,
                      [ entity_field_options ] ;
entity_field_options = "{", "generated", ":", "identity", "}" ;
entity_dossier_item = "identity", ":", identifier
                    | persistence_capability
                    | representation_declaration ;
persistence_capability
                    = "persistence", "{",
                      "store", ":", identifier,
                      "role", ":", "authority",
                      { "unique", ":", identifier },
                      "}" ;
representation_declaration
                    = ( "cache" | "projection" ), identifier, "{",
                      "store", ":", identifier,
                      "from", ":", identifier,
                      [ "strategy", ":", identifier ],
                      "delivery", ":", "durable",
                      "}" ;
entity_operation    = function_declaration | action_declaration
                    | query_declaration ;
query_declaration   = "query", identifier, parameters,
                      "freshness", ":", freshness,
                      [ fails_clause ], "->", type_expression, block ;
freshness           = "authoritative" | "read_your_writes"
                    | "bounded_staleness" | "eventual" ;
```

An entity operation may use `self: ref` or `self: value`; the compiler lowers
these to `Entity.Ref` or the complete entity snapshot. A mutating value receiver
also requires `guard: reload` or `guard: revision`. Actions may declare
`consistency: atomic` or `consistency: durable_workflow`. Top-level named
queries use the same `query_declaration` form. Entity-centred operations are
indexed under the qualified name `Entity.operation`; dot calls are checked
qualified calls and never trigger an implicit load or save.

### Authored tests and fixtures

```ebnf
test_declaration    = "test", string_literal, [ "using", identifier ], block ;
fixture_declaration = "fixture", identifier, "{", { fixture_setting }, "}" ;
fixture_setting     = "clock", ":", "fixed", expression
                    | "config", "{", { fixture_config_value }, "}" ;
fixture_config_value = identifier, ":", expression
                     | identifier, ":", "secret", "(", expression, ")" ;
assert_statement    = "assert", expression ;
advance_statement   = "advance", "clock", "by", expression ;
```

An assertion must evaluate to `Bool`. Tests may use ordinary checked statements,
assertions and the supported test-only operations. `advance clock by` requires
a fixture clock and a fixed duration. Fixture configuration is checked against
the application's `config` declaration; secret fields use `secret(...)`.
The [time/testing plan](time-testing-plan.md) defines the detailed isolation and
capability boundaries.

A minimal executable test needs no HTTP service:

```jadpo
type CardTitle = Text { min_length: 3 max_length: 12 }

test "a valid title is preserved" {
    var title = CardTitle("First card")
    assert title == CardTitle("First card")
}
```

Run `jadpo test <project>`. A project with no authored `test` declarations reports
`TEST_NO_TESTS`; a successful `check` or `build` alone does not run tests. Each
fixture-backed test receives fresh supported test state. Root `app.jadpo` may
contain shared failures and tests; recognised role directories constrain the
kinds of declarations they contain, as described in the
[project-role contract](entity-query-model.md#10-project-roles).

## 5. Type expressions

```ebnf
type_expression     = primary_type, [ "?" ] ;

primary_type        = named_type
                    | field_type
                    | generic_type
                    | inline_object_type ;

named_type          = identifier ;
field_type          = identifier, ".", identifier ;
generic_type        = identifier, "<", type_expression,
                      { ",", type_expression }, ">" ;
inline_object_type  = "Object", object_body ;
```

`Customer.email` is parsed as a field type in type position and as member access
in expression position. Name resolution determines whether the owner declaration
and field exist.

The parser and runtime support the prelude containers `List<T>`, `Set<T>`, and
`Map<K, V>`. User-defined generic declarations remain unsupported.

Applying `?` to an already nullable field type is a redundant-nullability
diagnostic rather than nested optionality.

## 6. Type and constraint declarations

```ebnf
type_declaration    = "type", identifier, "=",
                      ( scalar_type_body | object_type_body | enum_type_body ) ;

scalar_type_body    = type_expression, constraint_block ;
object_type_body    = "Object", object_body ;
enum_type_body      = "Enum", "{", enum_variant, { enum_variant }, "}" ;
enum_variant        = identifier, [ object_body ] ;

constraint_block    = "{", { constraint }, "}" ;

constraint          = "min", ":", number_literal
                    | "max", ":", number_literal
                    | "min_length", ":", integer_literal
                    | "max_length", ":", integer_literal
                    | "pattern", ":", string_literal
                    | "format", ":", identifier ;

number_literal      = integer_literal | decimal_literal ;
```

The core constraint vocabulary is `min`, `max`, `min_length`, `max_length`,
`pattern`, and `format: email`. Unknown constraints are errors rather than
arbitrary callbacks.

Every `type` declaration creates a new nominal type. The syntax never means a
transparent alias.

## 7. Object types and persistence

```ebnf
object_body         = "{", { field_declaration }, "}" ;

field_declaration   = identifier, ":", type_expression,
                      [ constraint_block ], [ "default", none_literal ],
                      [ "optional" ] ;

persistence_declaration = "persist", identifier, "{",
                            { persistence_item },
                          "}" ;
persistence_item    = "identity", ":", identifier
                    | "unique", ":", identifier
                    | "index", ":", identifier
                    | reference_item
                    | inverse_declaration ;
reference_item      = "references", identifier, ":", qualified_name,
                      [ "as", ":", identifier ],
                      "on_delete", ":", reference_delete_action ;
reference_delete_action = "restrict" | "cascade" | "set_null" ;
inverse_declaration = "inverse", identifier, ":", inverse_cardinality, identifier,
                      "via", ":", qualified_name ;
inverse_cardinality = "many" | "optional" ;
```

On a persistent entity's required `Uuid` identity field, `generated: identity`
assigns the identity in compiler-generated create code. It is reserved for the
field named by the entity's `identity` item; callers cannot supply it.

`optional` is meaningful when an object is used as route input. It means the
field may be omitted from that boundary shape and is distinct from `?`, which
means a supplied value may be `none`. An `input` field may instead use
`default none` when its type is nullable. The decoder then materializes `none`
when the request omits that field; the normalized input always has the field.
This default form is not accepted on entities, values, outputs, enums,
principals, failures, or route-path schemas.

Every field declaration creates a nominal field type refining the written type.
Field constraints, if present, further refine intrinsic value validation.

`persist Name { ... }` is the only storage opt-in. A persisted object may
declare at most one non-nullable `identity`; it becomes the generated primary
key. `unique` creates a stable named unique constraint, while `index` creates a
stable named non-unique index. These are storage properties and do not become
part of the field's nominal value type. Without `persist`, an object type is
ordinary non-persistent application data.

An owning field on a persisted object may declare
`references owner_id: User.id as: owner on_delete: cascade` (or
`restrict`/`set_null`). `as owner` explicitly separates the logical traversal
name from a stored field such as `owner_id`; when it is omitted, the field name
is also the relationship name. The compiler never infers a name by stripping
an `_id` suffix. The referenced field must be a non-nullable identity or unique
field, and the owning field's nominal type must be that exact field type.
`set_null` additionally requires a nullable owner field. The compiler generates
a foreign key and lookup index, orders fresh-schema table creation by
dependency, and diagnoses cross-object dependency cycles it cannot emit.
A persisted object may declare an inverse collection as
`inverse todos: many Todo via: Todo.owner_id`, or a zero-or-one inverse as
`inverse profile: optional Profile via: Profile.user_id`. The `via` field must
be an owning reference on the named child entity that points back to the
declaring parent. An optional inverse additionally requires that field to be
`identity` or `unique`, making the at-most-one claim enforceable in storage.
Inverse declarations are metadata, not stored entity fields and not implicit
lazy-loading accessors.

## 8. Configuration declarations

```ebnf
config_declaration  = "config", identifier, "{",
                        { config_field },
                      "}" ;

config_field        = identifier, ":", type_expression, "{",
                        config_binding,
                        [ config_secret ],
                        [ config_default ],
                      "}" ;

config_binding      = "binding", ":", string_literal ;
config_secret       = "secret", ":", boolean_literal ;
config_default      = "default", ":",
                      ( string_literal | integer_literal | decimal_literal
                      | boolean_literal | duration_literal ) ;
duration_literal    = number, ( "ms" | "s" | "m" | "h" | "d" ) ;
```

There is exactly one application configuration declaration. Options are
structured and may be written in any order, but each may appear at most once.
Every field has one non-empty, portable environment `binding`; fields are
required unless they have a checked literal `default`. A `secret: true` field
cannot have a source default and may flow only to a compiler-owned declared
secret sink. All v0.1 fields are startup-bound. Authored behavior reads typed
values through `config.<field>` and cannot inspect the process environment.

Local development uses `.env.local`; it is not part of this source grammar.
Generated production startup reads only declared binding names and disables
automatic environment-file discovery.

## 9. Failure declarations

```ebnf
failure_declaration = "failure", identifier, "{",
                        "kind", ":", identifier,
                        "code", ":", string_literal,
                        [ "message", ":", string_literal ],
                        [ public_schema ],
                        [ internal_schema ],
                      "}" ;

public_schema       = "public", record_body ;
internal_schema     = "internal", record_body ;
```

The identifier after `kind` must resolve to a standard failure kind. `public`
and `internal` schemas use field declarations but cannot use `optional` in the
first slice. Their field names must be disjoint, and public codes are stable
contract values. Rejection sites supply one flat object containing exactly the
combined public and internal fields; the declaration remains the sole owner of
which values may cross the public boundary.

Compatible-code alias syntax is deferred under `FAIL-002`; the seed does not
need it.

## 10. Callable declarations

```ebnf
function_declaration = "function", identifier, parameter_list,
                       [ fails_clause ], "->", type_expression, block ;

action_declaration   = "action", identifier, parameter_list,
                       [ fails_clause ], "->", type_expression, block ;

parameter_list       = "(", [ parameter,
                         { ",", parameter } ], ")" ;
parameter            = identifier, ":", type_expression ;

fails_clause         = "fails", identifier, { ",", identifier } ;
```

Functions are pure in the core. Actions may reject declared domain failures.
The P10 extension permits `create`, `query optional`, `query required`,
`update required`, and `delete required` only inside actions; other database
and external effects remain unavailable until their compiler phases.

Raw representation primitives in application callable parameter or return
positions are semantic errors, not parse errors.

## 11. Statements

```ebnf
block               = "{", { statement }, "}" ;

statement           = binding_statement
                    | assignment_statement
                    | return_statement
                    | reject_statement
                    | if_statement ;

binding_statement   = "var", [ "mut" ], identifier,
                      [ ":", type_expression ], "=", expression ;

assignment_statement = identifier, "=", expression ;

return_statement    = "return", expression ;

reject_statement    = "reject", identifier, [ rejection_body ] ;

rejection_body      = object_body ;

if_statement        = "if", expression, block, [ "else", block ] ;
```

There are no semicolons. Assignment is distinguished by the single `=` after a
bare local name; equality uses `==`, and arbitrary expression statements are
not accepted. Loops remain outside the first slice. `attempt` is an expression
prefix, not a statement or handler form.

`var` bindings and parameters are immutable. Only a local introduced with
`var mut` may be reassigned, and every assigned value must be compatible with
the binding's established nominal type. Assignment cannot target a parameter, field path, or
other value. This is local rebinding rather than observable reference or
interior mutation.

```

`Email(value)` and `register_customer(input)` share the same invocation syntax.
Name resolution distinguishes validated type construction from callable
invocation. A qualified name without a suffix represents a binding or field
access. A qualified name followed by an object body is record construction.

The accepted callable-ownership rule additionally reserves lowercase
compiler-owned standard-library namespaces such as `temporal` and `collection`.
Their operations use one mandatory qualified spelling. They cannot be opened by
an import, shadowed, aliased, or mirrored as receiver methods. Authored free
callables remain unqualified within their module or selective-import scope;
entity-owned operations retain their existing entity-qualified or receiver-dot
forms. The grammar already accepts the shared qualified-name shape; individual
standard-library families enter the executable prelude with their owning
implementation milestone.

Every invocation or persistence expression that can fail must be acknowledged
with `attempt` or, for a direct callable invocation, an exhaustive outcome
match. `attempt` propagates the exact failure set. An outcome match contains
exactly one `success(value)` arm and one named arm for every callable failure;
wildcards are rejected. A failure arm returns a compatible replacement value,
rejects a mapped failure, or uses `propagate`. The callable's `fails` clause
must equal the complete reachable, unhandled set after those decisions.
Failure-context binding is not part of this executable grammar.

`RegistrationAccepted { email: input.email }` constructs a complete record.
`create Customer { ... }` is the P10 persistent-create expression. Its target
must be an entity, its object body must be complete, and the expression has the
entity's nominal type. A function using it is an effect error.
Each initialiser is checked against the field's nominal identity, such as
`Customer.id`, rather than only its declared representation parent.
An optional `conflict:` binding translates a normalised database constraint
violation into a failure declared by the action and derived from `Conflict`.
Without that binding, a constraint violation remains an operational fault.
Specific bindings use a compiler-owned identity, for example
`conflict Account.handle: AccountHandleTaken`; several specific bindings may
precede one fallback. Unknown or duplicate mappings are rejected.

`query optional Customer { where: id == input.id }` has type `Customer?`: zero
rows produce `none`. `query required` has the non-nullable entity type and must
include `missing: FailureName`; that failure must be declared by the action and
derive from `NotFound`. The binding may supply the same typed `public` and
`internal` context as `reject`. Both forms validate one returned row and treat
multiple rows as a contained operational cardinality fault. Query targets must
be entities, predicate fields must be known and non-nullable, and values must
carry the field's nominal identity. Queries are action-only. Many-result,
compound predicates and projections remain outside this slice.

`query many Todo { ... order_by: id asc limit: 100 offset: 0 }` has type
`List<Todo>`. Ordering is
mandatory, and the ordering field must currently be an identity or unique key
so results are deterministic without an implicit tie-breaker. Every returned
row is validated as the entity before it enters the collection. Literal
pagination is optional for a direct many query and parameterised when present;
compound predicates remain outside this slice.

A required parent query may explicitly include one or more inverse collections:

```text
attempt query required User {
    where: id == input.id
    include: todos into: UserActivity order_by: id asc limit: 100 offset: 0
    include: notes into: UserActivity order_by: id desc limit: 20 offset: 0
    missing: UserNotFound
}
```

The named output must contain exactly `parent: User` and one field matching
each included inverse name, such as `todos: List<Todo>` and
`notes: List<Note>`. Repeated includes must use the same output shape; duplicate
relationships are rejected. Each child ordering key must be identity or
unique. `limit` must be a positive integer literal and `offset` a
non-negative integer literal in this first bounded slice. Both become SQL
parameters. The compiler currently chooses a bounded two-query batch, validates
the parent and every child before constructing the output, and records that
choice in persistence query-plan metadata. Ordinary entity queries never load
relationships implicitly.

A `many` parent query may include the same nested shape only when the parent
query itself has deterministic ordering and explicit pagination:

```text
attempt query many User {
    where: group == input.group
    order_by: id asc
    limit: 20 offset: 0
    include: todos into: UserTodos order_by: id asc limit: 100 offset: 0
}
```

This form has type `List<UserTodos>`. The generated plan pages parents in a CTE
before joining ranked child rows, so child expansion cannot change which
parents belong to the page. The one-include plan executes as one query and is
recorded as `parent_page_join` metadata. With repeated includes, the compiler
executes one independently bounded parent-page join per relationship and merges
them by the deterministic parent key, avoiding both Cartesian multiplication
and N+1 execution.

A required child query may instead traverse one owning reference to its parent:

```text
attempt query required PatchItem {
    where: id == input.id
    include: reviewer_id optional into: PatchItemReviewer
    missing: PatchItemNotFound
}
```

The included name is the stored reference field. `optional` is required when
that field is nullable and produces an output field of type `Parent?`;
`required` is accepted only for a non-nullable reference and produces
`Parent`. The output contains exactly `parent: PatchItem` plus the included
field. The generated bounded plan reads the child and then the referenced
parent, performs no lazy access, and records `bounded_parent_lookup` with a
query count of two.

A required parent query may load a declared optional inverse:

```text
attempt query required User {
    where: id == input.id
    include: profile optional into: UserProfile
    missing: UserNotFound
}
```

The output contains exactly `parent: User` and `profile: Profile?`. The child
owning reference must be unique, and the generated two-query
`bounded_optional_inverse` plan returns `none` when no child exists.

The first nested slice accepts exactly two hops: a non-nullable owning reference
followed by a declared optional inverse:

```text
attempt query required Todo {
    where: id == input.id
    include: owner.profile optional into: TodoOwnerProfile
    missing: TodoNotFound
}
```

The outer output contains `parent: Todo` and `owner: UserProfile`; the inner
output contains `parent: User` and `profile: Profile?`. The compiler rejects
other hop/cardinality combinations and records a `bounded_nested_lookup` with
`maximum_depth: 2` and `query_count: 3`.

`update required` and `delete required` each match exactly one entity or reject
their declared `missing:` failure, which must derive from `NotFound`. Database
constraint violations reject the declared `conflict:` failure, which must
derive from `Conflict`. Both expressions return the validated affected entity.
An update either requires one or more distinct fields in `set:`, or names a
direct input binding in `patch:`. Every replacement is checked against its
entity field's nominal identity. A patch input is a non-empty record whose
fields are all declared `optional` and correspond to known target fields. If no
patch field was supplied, `empty:` rejects a declared `InvalidValue` failure.
For each patch field, one fixed parameterised statement binds a supplied flag
and a value; omitted fields retain their stored values, while an explicitly
supplied `none` clears a nullable field. An optional following `set:` block may
add fixed derived writes; `value when patch.field supplied` applies only when
that exact patch field was present. A field cannot be written by both `patch:`
and derived `set:`. The generated adapter preflights
cardinality and mutates inside the current prototype's inferred action
transaction, so multiple matches or constraint failures leave no partially
committed fields. The accepted entity/query model retains failure atomicity but
requires explicit intent before several entity mutation scopes are combined.

The exact colon-delimited spelling for named compound uniqueness remains open.
The former call-shaped `constraint name: unique(field_a, field_b)` spelling is
not canonical and must not be copied into new source.

The expression grammar implements conventional precedence for unary `not` and
`-`; multiplicative `*`, `/`, and `%`; additive `+` and `-`; ordering `<`,
`<=`, `>`, and `>=`; equality `==` and `!=`; `and`; then `or`. Arithmetic is
numeric except for `Text + Text`, and `match` is exhaustive for closed domains.

## 13. Route declarations

```ebnf
route_declaration   = "route", http_method, route_path, "{",
                        { route_item },
                      "}" ;

http_method         = "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "PATCH" | "DELETE" ;
route_path          = path_token ;

route_item          = "auth", ":", "none"
                    | "path", ":", route_path_schema
                    | "query", ":", type_expression
                    | "headers", ":", route_header_schema
                    | "deadline", ":", duration_literal
                    | "input", ":", type_expression
                    | "output", ":", type_expression
                    | "success", ":", ("created" | "no_content")
                    | "run", ":", qualified_name, invocation_suffix
                    | inline_action ;

route_path_schema   = "{", { field_declaration }, "}" ;
route_header_schema = "{", { identifier, ":", type_expression,
                              "from", string_literal, [ "optional" ] }, "}" ;
inline_action       = "action", ":", [ fails_clause ], block ;
```

The first route item above is spelled `auth: none`; the older
`auth: public explicitly` form is not accepted. Authentication is required when
`auth: none` is absent. Any other authored value produces the human-owned
`route.auth_value_invalid` diagnostic over that value. The diagnostic does not
guess whether authentication should be retained or disabled: it offers removal
of the item and replacement with `none` as two non-preferred choices, reports
their distinct public-security effects, and recovers at the next route item so
valid `input:`, `output:`, and `run:` members do not become cascade errors.

The lexer reads the non-whitespace token after the method as `path_token`.
Every `{name}` placeholder must have exactly one same-named typed field in the
`path: { ... }` block, and every path field must have exactly one placeholder.
Path fields contain only a required semantic type; nullable/optional fields,
constraints, references, and persistence modifiers are invalid there.
Handler expressions access those bindings as `path.name`. Matching is exact;
each matched segment is percent-decoded and nominally validated before the
handler runs.

`query:` references one named closed Object and exposes its validated fields as
`query.name`. Query wire keys are the exact lower-snake field names. The target
validates percent escapes and UTF-8 before form decoding, decodes once, rejects
unknown or duplicate keys, and treats structured field values as one JSON value.
Malformed encoding, scalar spelling, or JSON is a 400 `invalid_request`;
well-formed values that fail the declared shape or constraints are a 422
`invalid_value`. `Int` values outside the JavaScript safe-integer range are
well-formed but rejected with 422 before a lossy conversion. Optional fields remain absent and source defaults apply only
when the key is absent; an empty present value never selects a default.

`headers:` declares an anonymous group with an explicit HTTP wire name for each
binding and exposes fields as `headers.name`. Header wire names must be valid
ASCII field names. Static checking rejects duplicate names case-insensitively,
structured or nullable header fields, cross-boundary binding-name collisions,
and credential, CSRF, trusted-identity, or compiler-owned `X-Jadpo-*` headers.
The Bun Fetch request loses ordinary repeated-header multiplicity. A generated
application containing `headers:` therefore starts through Bun's built-in
`node:http` compatibility layer, counts `IncomingMessage.rawHeaders` before
constructing a Fetch `Request`, and rejects a repeated declared name before
binding its value. Non-GET/HEAD bodies remain streamed through that adapter so
authentication and CSRF checks precede body consumption. Calling the exported Fetch handler without that raw metadata
fails closed for a route that declares ordinary headers.

Every route item uses `:` between its name and value. Space-only forms such as
`input CreateOrder` are syntax errors rather than alternate spellings.

A core route has at most one path, query, headers, input, output, and success item and exactly
one behaviour: either `run:` or one inline `action:`, never both. Their textual
order is not semantic; the formatter chooses a canonical order.

`deadline:` optionally sets a positive fixed execution budget for that route's
handler operation. It has no implicit default. The monotonic budget begins when
the handler behavior starts and follows nested calls, transactions, retries and
checked service calls. It stops new work and prevents a transaction from
committing after its database work returns late; it does not promise interruption
of an active database call or a hard response-time bound. Confirmed commits and
uncertain external effects keep their ordinary outcome rules.

Successful responses default to 200. `success: created` selects 201 and
requires an output type matching the action result. `success: no_content`
selects an empty 204 response and requires a `Unit` result with no route output.
The compiler emits these statuses in route inventory and OpenAPI; failures
retain their kind-derived statuses.

Protected routes expose the authenticated sum as `current_principal`. Selecting
`current_principal.user` or `current_principal.service` narrows it to the
corresponding principal variant before it is passed to a typed query or action.
Generated handlers enforce the selected variant and return the standard 403
authorization fault when the authenticated principal has a different kind.

Reachable failures are derived through `run` or the inline action's exact
`fails` set. Routes do not contain numeric status mappings.

## 14. Core prelude

This section describes the current implemented prelude, including TIME-001.

The compiler initially recognises these representation or standard semantic
types without user declarations:

```text
Bool
Int
Decimal
Text
Bytes
Uuid
Instant
CalendarDate
Time
Duration
Zone
Locale
PresentationText
InstantRange
LocalOverlap
LocalGap
InvalidDay
Weekday
TimeFormat
FriendlyTimeFormat
Unit
Object
List<T>
Set<T>
Map<K, V>
Email
Url
IpAddress
```

It also recognises the initial standard failure kinds, including
`RateLimited`, `Unavailable`, `TimedOut`, and `OutcomeUnknown`, from the
[failure model](failure-model.md). Application declarations cannot shadow
prelude names.

Prelude types still obey semantic rules. For example, `Text` cannot be used as
an ordinary application callable parameter merely because it is in the prelude.

## 15. P10.5 module extension

The optional module grammar is:

```text
module-declaration ::= "module" qualified-name
import-declaration ::= "import" qualified-name "{" name ("," name)* "}"
public-declaration ::= "public" declaration
```

A modular source file begins with exactly one `module` declaration, followed by
zero or more selective imports and then declarations. Once any source file in a
project declares a module, every source file must declare one. Module names are
explicit stable logical identities; directory names do not silently become
semantic namespaces.

Declarations are private to their module unless prefixed with `public`.
Imports name a module and a non-empty set of its public declarations. Importing
a private or unknown declaration, using a cross-file declaration without an
import, importing the same local name twice, colliding with a local declaration,
declaring the same module in two files, mixing modular and ambient files, or
forming an import cycle is an error. Routes cannot use the module `public`
prefix because their external visibility is governed by route and policy
semantics.

The checked manifest records canonical module names, source files, selective
imports, and exports. The bounded first implementation retains globally unique
declaration names internally; aliases, re-exports, same-name declarations in
separate modules, relative imports, multi-file modules, and external packages
remain unsupported rather than receiving implicit semantics.

Legacy projects with no module headers retain the original single ambient
namespace so existing core fixtures and the Jadpo seed remain valid.

### Checked scheduled-job frontend — 2026-10-04

The independently reviewed ASYNC-001 frontend slice recognises this closed
schedule entry; it does **not** implement worker execution. Jobs are lower_snake_case,
non-callable and non-exported. Body clauses may be reordered, but each is required
exactly once. An optional closed delivery descriptor is parsed as described below,
but its checked analysis is explicitly unsupported. No other job properties or
inline action bodies are accepted.

```ebnf
job_declaration     = "job", identifier, "every", duration_literal, "{",
                      { job_item }, "}" ;
job_item            = "concurrency", ":", "singleton"
                    | "run", ":", invocation_expression
                    | "retry", ":", "next_schedule"
                    | "delivery", ":", "reminder_v1", reminder_descriptor ;
```

The interval must represent positive, finite integral milliseconds within the
runtime's safe integer range, with ms/s/m/h units. Integrality is validated from
the exact authored decimal spelling; floating-point rounding cannot make an
otherwise invalid interval valid. Exact fractional units such as `0.001s` are
supported. Run names resolve exactly to a
checked action with one nonnullable, unconstrained named scalar directly based on
Instant, and builtin Unit result. Its sole positional argument explicitly
constructs that exact nominal type from intrinsic `clock.now`, for example
`scan(JobRunAt(clock.now))` with `type JobRunAt = Instant {}`. Bare primitives,
implicit conversion, sibling/constrained/indirect/nullable wrappers, unknown
receivers, functions/queries, named/extra/arbitrary-nested/principal
arguments and authored delivery authority reject. The semantic graph and job
audit derive static calls, failure contracts, constructor-validation proof and
reachable external effects;
`next_schedule` is only a wake-up choice. Durable dispositions, finite profiles
and checked worker bindings remain pending, so target/build returns
`JADPO_TARGET_JOB_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, never silently omits or executes a job.
Event/subscriber successor grammar below remains separate and unimplemented.

**Closed delivery descriptor syntax stage — 2026-10-05:** the parser accepts
exactly one optional `delivery: reminder_v1 { ... }` with all five sections
`selection`, `hooks`, `service`, `authority`, `completion` exactly once. Every
section uses its closed required-key catalogue, specified in the
[reviewed exact source recipe](work-plans/golden-delivery-planning.md#rm-301307108--services-durable-jobs-and-reminders).
Keys/sections may be reordered; unknown, missing or duplicate keys reject. No
semicolons or arbitrary expression/config/record map is accepted. Direct references
are qualified names, open is `field(enum.variant)`, cursor is exactly two ordered
qualified fields with `asc` and one comma, limit is literal500, and payload version
is exactly `"reminder.v1"`. Generated intent, operation-time, continuation, narrow
permit and compiler-observation terms are closed and position-specific; they are
not ordinary intrinsics or capabilities. Formatter canonicalizes section/key order
while preserving tokens, comments and cursor order. Recovery preserves later jobs
and declarations, including after an unterminated descriptor.

This stage is source syntax only. `TYPE_JOB_DELIVERY_BINDING_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
rejects normal checked analysis before a checked job binding/export can omit the
descriptor. The typed sealed-origin/hook/phase-policy successor and independent
implementation review remain required; neither syntactic names nor the grammar
grant authority or execution. Worker build stays fail-closed, execution profile
unset, and no scheduler/registry/no-op is generated.

## 16. Explicitly unsupported in the first slice

The parser or semantic checker produces a stable unsupported-feature diagnostic
for:

- import aliases, re-exports, relative imports, multi-file modules, same-name
  declarations in separate modules, and external packages;
- loops and recursion;
- assignment outside a bare, fixed-type `var mut` local;
- failure-context binding in outcome arms;
- compound many-result predicates and general patch-condition expressions;
- services, events, and jobs in the original first slice; the later checked
  service and non-executing scheduled-job subsets are specified separately;
- policies and `require`;
- query/header/body route bindings;
- defaults and compound non-unique indexes;
- relationship paths deeper than two, nested to-many paths without per-hop
  bounds, and required inverse-one declarations without an enforceable totality
  model or explicit domain absence path;
- generic user-defined types;
- transparent aliases;
- macros, reflection, and escape hatches.

Enum variants use qualified dot syntax such as
`InviteStatus.blocked`; `InviteStatus("blocked")` and dynamic call-style enum
construction are invalid.

Unsupported does not mean rejected forever. It means the feature cannot enter
the implementation without a specification and fixture.

## 17. Seed coverage

The [Jadpo seed](../examples/jadpo-seed/app.jadpo) exercises:

- constrained nominal types;
- an object type, a separate persistence declaration, and field type references;
- route input and output roles using ordinary object types;
- field refinement chains;
- a standard-kind domain failure with flat rejection context and a declaration-
  owned internal field;
- an action with exact `fails`, `if`, validated construction, `reject`,
  `attempt`, and `return`;
- explicit `auth: none` routes using named and inline behaviour, including a
  typed path binding;
- automatic failure-to-boundary metadata.

Every token in that file is covered by this grammar. Its semantic expectations
are recorded separately so parser success cannot be mistaken for compiler
correctness.

## 18. Successor grammar candidate — 2026-10-04

**Not implemented or frozen.** These candidate productions belong to RM-222/
RM-309 and do not replace the current grammar above. The
[syntax inventory](syntax.md#22-successor-syntax-review--2026-10-04) records owner
choices and the selected query form; the [event model](event-model.md)
owns effects, payload and delivery rules.

The plain `text` fence keeps this proposed EBNF delta separate from the
implemented `ebnf` productions checked by the formatter coverage matrix.

```text
event_declaration   = "event", type_identifier, "{",
                      event_variant, { event_variant }, "}" ;
event_variant       = runtime_identifier, "{", { field_declaration },

```

`type_identifier` and `runtime_identifier` mean the accepted casing categories,
not new lexical token types. `event_variant_reference`, `module_path` and
`entity_reference` use existing qualified-name syntax with checked resolution.
An unqualified variant is rejected. Event payload fields use typed declarations, distinct from value construction’s
`object_body`; the optional policy block is metadata, not a payload field. Empty payload records
are allowed. Event registration/version/envelope fields are generated, not
authored as payload properties.

Handler payload bindings (for example `payload`) are inferred from their selectors.
Declaration keywords such as `event` remain hard-reserved in bindings/references;
the candidate adds no contextual-keyword exception. Their reachable
failure/effect sets are computed for the durable boundary and must have reviewed
dispositions; normal subscriber source does not need an execution-key or
authored retry loop. Unlike an ordinary action, a handler is not callable and
does not expose a public caller-return/failure signature. Ordinary helper
actions retain exact `fails` declarations and prefix `attempt`.

The query bodies expand the implemented required/optional/many forms and the
later page parser rather than inventing a generic predicate language. The existing
`include_clause`, relationship depth, output-shape, ordering, bounded child-load
and cardinality restrictions still apply; being syntactically representable does
not make an unsupported combination legal. Current direct `many` queries may omit
pagination; this migration must not claim to have added a bound absent from the
baseline. RM-218 owns any new numeric collection bound. Page predicates preserve
`matches optional` and `<= optional` presence semantics; `after: optional` still
requires the existing optional input-field provenance, not just a nullable value.
`page_predicate` uses the current bounded predicate operand parser, not an
arbitrary boolean expression that absorbs subsequent clauses.

The page result moves from `-> PageType` into `into: PageType`. The cursor is a
type reference; its field tuple is derived from `order_by`, matching the current
requirement that the two tuples are identical. Preserve existing cursor shape,
nominal checks, codec/versioning and runtime ordering rules; do not infer fields
from incidental record declaration order. Unsupported cursor shapes still fail.
The `type_reference` nonterminal here denotes the existing checked type-reference
parser (including the same qualified and generic form); it is not a value call.

Creation puts authored values under `values:` so normal field names cannot be
confused with conflict-handling clauses. Specific constraint mappings precede at
most one fallback and retain exact typed failures. Updates/deletes remain
identity-bounded, exactly-one mutations without an authored cardinality choice.
Transition plus set/patch is allowed only for other writable fields: existing
lifecycle ownership rejects writes to transition-controlled fields. Generated
fields, patch presence/empty handling and failure bindings retain their checks.
The production fixes clause order for one canonical formatter output; arbitrary
field reordering/duplicate metadata is not a second default dialect.

`effect_statement` is new successor syntax: the current parser rejects general
expression statements. It is checked only for an admitted invocation/emission
whose success type is exactly `Unit`. `emit_event` is a reserved intrinsic,
excluded from the ordinary qualified-call branch, and always requires prefix
`attempt`, including when its only possible failures are operational boundary
faults. The expression form has the same acknowledgement requirement. Direct
`match emit_event(...)` is unsupported; this delta creates no intrinsic outcome
API. Ordinary calls keep existing exact-failure acknowledgement/matching rules. Values/receipts require a binding, return or applicable
match. Pure expressions, constructors, non-`Unit` results and unsupported calls
cannot be silently discarded. Blocks remain delimiter-based with no semicolons;
this introduces neither arbitrary callbacks nor trailing-closure syntax.

Event policies add event-local `invoke`/`read` applicability and a bounded scope
binding as specified in the event candidate; they do not modify frozen entity
policy. `field_declaration` uses the existing typed payload-field form without
storage/generated/entity metadata. `trigger_clause` is allowed on entity/service
contracts and as a narrowing clause on their protected transition/operation.
No body-local trigger annotation or helper may grant effect authority.

The component candidate maps one explicit logical module subtree to an owner;
overlapping mappings fail, and no file path determines authority. This avoids
changing the existing single-file module rule merely to support cross-file
private actions. Component declarations and ownership changes need semantic/
policy review; the spelling is a candidate, not an owner-selected addition.

`publish:` would extend an existing entity lifecycle transition declaration,
not create another callable or require a manual emission. Its payload may use
checked `before`/`after` snapshots under the event contract. The current closed
transition grammar does not yet include publication. The candidate
`triggers` clause supplies a restriction at entity/service leaves, including
same-component reactions; effect, policy and publication checks remain separate.
These extensions still require qualification against their owning contracts.

The new singleton principal still requires the accepted closed variants. The
compiler supplies `Principal` and rejects conflicting declarations/imports;
existing custom-name references and selector configuration migrate together.
The reviewed current grammar remains active until RM-223 qualifies conversion.
