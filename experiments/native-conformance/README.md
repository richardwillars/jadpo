# Shared Rust conformance slice

Follow-up to the native experiment. Keep both prior experiments and the selected
WASM candidate frozen. This is a local conformance variant, not a replacement
performance candidate, production migration, or change to Jadpo's language.

Bounded scope:

- Extract a target-independent generated Rust crate with explicit request state.
  Exercise that same crate natively and in a new local WASM module.
- Preserve the documented fallback-conflict contract: any normalized constraint
  maps through the authored fallback; ordinary driver faults remain internal.
- Enforce host/completion budgets inside Bun's generated transaction callback so
  rejected oversized writes roll back, without editing the generated Bun program.
- Check independent suspended requests, stale handles, cancellation, thread
  transfer, driver faults, real SQLite transactions and existing fixture parity.
- Re-run checked source rename/refinement and unsupported-plan gates. Record
  new module hashes and archive results separately. Do not reuse old performance
  scores for changed artifacts or qualify workerd/cloud behavior from Bun hosting.

The existing failure contract is in `docs/failure-model.md` (fallback conflicts)
and `docs/grammar-v0.1.md` (normalized constraint violations). A new language
interpretation is unnecessary. Policy/authentication expansion, general savepoint
lowering, production HTTP and optimized WASM transport remain outside this slice.

## Results and reproduction

See the [completed conformance report](../../docs/shared-rust-conformance-results.md).
The original native performance campaign is not retimed or overwritten here.

### Simple builds

From the repository root:

```sh
jadpo build --target wasm
jadpo build --target native
```

These commands do not invoke Bun. `--target rust` is an alias for `native`.
If the CLI is not installed, prefix `build --target ...` with
`cargo run --offline --locked --manifest-path jadpo/Cargo.toml -p jadpo-cli --`.
The CLI locates the experiment in the current checkout; an installed CLI alone
does not bundle these experimental sources. Only the conformance fixture is
accepted (as the default or an explicit project path). Other projects fail before
generation; ordinary `jadpo build <project>` still builds the existing Bun target.

Each command checks `experiments/wasm-exp1/fixture` from source and generates the
same shared Rust before building only the requested release target. It does not
require an existing projection or rebuild the frozen WASM candidate. Run the two
commands sequentially because they share generated files.

| Command | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `jadpo build --target wasm` | `experiments/native-conformance/build/application.wasm` |
| `jadpo build --target native` | `build/native-conformance/target/release/jadpo-native-conformance` |

Prerequisites: Python 3, Cargo/Rust (verified with Rust 1.78.0), a native C
toolchain and SQLite development library for rusqlite. WASM also needs the Rust
target installed with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Builds use locked,
offline Cargo dependencies. On a machine without the dependency cache, first run:

```sh
cargo fetch --locked --manifest-path experiments/wasm-exp1/compiler/Cargo.toml
cargo fetch --locked --manifest-path experiments/native-conformance/Cargo.toml
```

The existing `bun run build:wasm` and `bun run build:rust` shortcuts remain optional.
You can also use `sh experiments/native-conformance/build.sh --target wasm` or
`--target rust` directly. With no arguments that script builds both targets. An optional
`program.json` argument still accepts a checked projection for mutation testing.
The module and executable remain bounded experiment artifacts.

### Full conformance reproduction

Use the existing checked projection compiler and Bun baseline prerequisites from
`../wasm-exp1/baseline/README.md`. Rust dependencies are pinned by this workspace's
Cargo.lock. From the repository root:

```sh
sh experiments/native-conformance/build.sh
cargo test --offline --locked --manifest-path experiments/native-conformance/Cargo.toml --target-dir build/native-conformance/target
bun --no-install --env-file=/dev/null test experiments/native-conformance/wasm.test.ts experiments/native-conformance/wasm-sql.test.ts
python3 experiments/native-conformance/mutation.py
node experiments/native-conformance/run.mjs
python3 experiments/native-conformance/archive.py
```

Mutation restores and rebuilds the original afterward. Run these sequentially;
local HTTP tests require loopback-listener permission. All scratch databases/logs
stay under `build/native-conformance`; archives go only to this experiment.
`core` forbids unsafe code and has no database/HTTP dependency. `native` and `wasm`
both depend on that crate. The WASM ABI adapter has one slot per module instance;
its host must lease instances correctly. Core cancellation and rollback-on-drop
are tested, while HTTP disconnect cancellation remains outside this slice.
