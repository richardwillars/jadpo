# Golden todo design contract

**Status:** candidate freeze for P10R review  
**Contract version:** `todo-v0.1`  
**Compiler support:** intentionally incomplete

The [2026-09-30 reconciliation](REVIEW.md#2026-09-30-authentication-reconciliation)
aligns the five recorded authentication/query-budget discrepancies with approved
AUTH-001 and the owner's query-accounting decision. All 44 cases remain
unexecuted; the candidate is still not an executable or independently approved
application. Its principal carries identity, while application queries own
profile data.

This directory defines the todo backend that P10.5 and P11 must implement. It
is design evidence, not a demonstration of what the current compiler happens to
support. The source deliberately uses required authentication, policy,
omission-aware patches, lifecycle, job, service, configuration, and migration
constructs before their compiler implementations exist.

The approved [POLICY-001 plan](../../docs/policy-plan.md) now supersedes the
separate `policy.jadpo`, manual `require policy`, lifecycle-in-policy, and
field-allowlist spellings in this candidate. Their behavioural pressure remains
valid, but POLICY-P0/P6 must migrate them to qualified scoped roles, entity
permission matrices, relationship/membership bindings, narrowing field policy,
and compiler-injected query/mutation enforcement before implementation.

The candidate source predates the accepted DATA-007
[entity/query/transaction model](../../docs/entity-query-model.md). Its
behavioural, policy, acceptance, and adversarial obligations remain fixed
pressure evidence, while its top-level `type`/`persist`, free query, action, and
single-file layout are not final syntax authority. The fixture-first P10.6
revision must express the same contract through authoritative entity dossiers,
named queries, entity-owned mutations, and workflows without silently changing
the experiment.

The candidate source has been migrated onto the accepted TIME-001
[time contract](../../docs/time-testing-plan.md): exact moments use `Instant`,
creation and change timestamps use explicit compiler-owned lifecycle roles, and
the application no longer selects a production clock. The remaining TEST-001
boundary and fixture work is tracked separately and does not restore any legacy
date/time spelling.

The compiler-checked successor source is being assembled in the separate
[`golden-todo-migration` package](../golden-todo-migration/README.md) so the
pre-DATA-007 pressure source remains intact. Its first slices migrate the four
persistent domain entities, ownership references, and supported value/input/
output declarations, plus typed configuration, the bounded principal and user
authentication declarations, and the static public liveness route. This is
source migration evidence only: the package has not integrated protected
application operations or executed acceptance cases. A `TodoRole.owner` binding
and entity permission matrix preserve the direct Todo-owner scope. The
successor source now also represents the frozen User self-read equality as an
identity-bound `UserRole.self` with field narrowing. User disablement and
soft-delete lifecycle, protected operations, and integrated acceptance remain
open; the frozen human-owned policy file is untouched.

The package has two independent authorities:

1. [`policy.jadpo`](policy.jadpo) defines human-owned permission, field, effect,
   and lifecycle intent. Nothing else may weaken it.
2. [`acceptance.json`](acceptance.json) defines externally observable behaviour
   within that policy envelope.

The remaining artifacts are subordinate evidence:

3. [`app.jadpo`](app.jadpo) is the original proposed implementation source and
   retained pre-DATA-007 pressure case; its behaviour is authoritative input,
   while its superseded source organisation must be revised transparently.
4. [`expected-audit.md`](expected-audit.md) defines the derived review surface.
5. [`adversarial-changes.md`](adversarial-changes.md) defines change-pressure
   cases and required compiler dispositions.
6. [`typescript-baseline.md`](typescript-baseline.md) freezes the comparison
   stack and equivalent obligations.
7. [`language-friction.md`](language-friction.md) records every construct not
   expressible by the compiler at the time of this candidate freeze.
8. [`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md) records author-side contradictions and the pending
   independent-review checklist.

On 2026-10-02 the owner authorised a successor acceptance revision that keeps
`User.email` provisioning-only and omits it from the self-service
`UserWithTodos` response. The human-owned policy did not change; the predecessor
acceptance and both digests are retained in the
[review log](REVIEW.md#2026-10-02-owner-authorised-userwithtodos-email-revision).
The migrated route now uses a self-scoped parent lookup and a bounded indexed
Todo page; focused SQLite, PostgreSQL and JWT HTTP evidence is recorded in
[RM-107 history](../../docs/implementation-history.md#2026-10-02--rm-107-self-scoped-user-todo-route).
The frozen AUTH-007/REL-001 case entries remain unexecuted until the full
source-bound golden harness runs.

The compiler now supports explicit `success: created` and `success: no_content`
route outcomes. Golden application integration remains part of the outstanding
source migration and does not execute any acceptance case by itself.

The cross-package
[`evidence-map-v0.1.json`](../../tests/assurance/evidence-map-v0.1.json) links
every acceptance case to named proof/runtime-validation rules and threat-model
entries. It also keeps planned evidence visibly distinct from evidence that
already exists.

If source and acceptance behaviour disagree, the contradiction blocks freeze
until it is resolved. If acceptance behaviour exceeds policy, policy wins and
the case is invalid until a human-reviewed contract revision reconciles them.
An agent may not edit policy to make an implementation compile. Policy changes
require the approval protocol defined during P10R.

## Product behaviour

The application supports:

- browser sessions, user API bearers, service API keys/exchange, and opt-in JWT
  bearer validation normalised to one closed user/service principal;
- authenticated-by-default routes and one explicit public health route;
- fail-closed handling of invalid, conflicting, or ambiguous credentials;
- bounded revocation for ordinary traffic with fresh-authority checks on
  sensitive operations, without cache-dependent correctness;
- owner-scoped todo CRUD with omission-aware patches;
- stable cursor pagination and stable child ordering without N+1 reads;
- explicit owner relationship integrity and deletion lifecycle;
- optional due dates, overdue reminder scheduling, and a declared mail service;
- a soft-delete retention window followed by an idempotent purge job;
- typed configuration, secret handling, readiness, and startup preflight;
- generated structural tests plus authored business tests; and
- derived route, data, effect, failure, configuration, and policy evidence.

Sharing and administrator access are not present in the initial contract. They
enter through the frozen change sequence so the experiment can measure policy
evolution rather than beginning at the final answer.

## Freeze rule

This is a **candidate** freeze. P10R review may correct ambiguity once. After it
is marked frozen, changes require a new contract version and a rationale; P11
must not weaken or rewrite the cases to fit compiler limitations. A case may be
classified `unsupported`, `cannot prove`, or `requires human decision`, but it
may not silently disappear.

Run `python3 tools/verify-p10r.py` from the repository root to validate the
package and print informational candidate digests. Those digests are not a
freeze record until the independent P10R review is complete.

### Reviewed lifecycle and service successors — 2026-10-02

The [DATA-007 lifecycle contract](../../docs/lifecycle-plan.md) and
[SERVICE-001 semantic contract](../../docs/service-plan.md) are independently
reviewed and frozen for implementation. The pressure app/policy retain historical
spellings and bytes; the service successor replaces lifetime Todo deduplication
with a durable UUID per schedule revision and records the narrow policy identity
amendment. Its [JOB-001 overlay](../../tests/assurance/service-acceptance-successor-v0.1.json)
replaces only that case in the current 44-case matrix for future migration. These
are contract-only inputs: runtime acceptance and protected P10R review stay open.
